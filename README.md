## Components:
  Just the bare minimum.
  
## Nodes:

## Scripts:
  Installation and useful commands.

## Data:
  Just being used to fetch data from the server (which is positioned behind a firewall) without having to use multiple SCP commands.

## Flows:
  Every new flow added to the current implementation will be put in this directory. 

## Main flow used:
